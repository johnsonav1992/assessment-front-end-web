					My name is Alex and I am a 30-year-old husband and dad
					living in the amazing town of Keller, TX in the North Fort
					Worth area. I love doing so many things when I am not
					working, including but not limited to: making music,
					cooking, lawncare, running, cycling, being involved in my
					church and spending time with my family and friends. As a
					former band director and teacher, jumping into the software
					development field has certainly been new for me, but I am
					excited about the prospect of landing a position where I
					feel valued and truly enjoy my work.
